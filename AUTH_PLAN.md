# Authentication System Production-Ready Plan

---

## **1. Core Features**

- JWT access tokens with expiry
- Refresh tokens with rotation
- Secure password hashing
- Role-based access control
- Logout clearing tokens
- Basic validation (email, password strength)
- Clear success/error messages
- Frontend integration with refresh flow

---

## **2. Quality Assurance Steps**

- Manual testing of all auth flows
- Automated unit + integration tests
- Security checks (hashing, no plaintext, no sensitive logs)
- Rate limiting login attempts
- Sanitize inputs

---

## **3. Code Review Criteria**

- No mock data or placeholders
- No console.log/debug code left
- Proper error handling
- Consistent naming and structure
- Type safety enforced
- No duplicated logic
- Clear, descriptive commit messages
- Documentation/comments where needed

---

## **4. Enforcement Mechanisms**

- Pull request reviews required
- Automated linting and formatting
- Automated tests must pass
- Security scan (optional)
- Reject PRs with mock data or commented-out code

---

## **5. Workflow for Act Mode**

- Work in small, focused branches
- Implement one feature at a time
- Test locally before commit
- Write clear commit messages
- Push and create PR
- Review against criteria
- Merge only production-ready code

---

## **6. Summary**

- No mock data or placeholders in production code
- Strict QA and review before merge
- Clear, enforceable standards
- Guided Act Mode development
- Result: secure, maintainable, production-ready authentication

---

## **Excluded for now**

- OAuth/social login
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

---

This plan ensures a **robust, secure, production-grade authentication system**.
